## Read size
The size of the reas can tell us how big is the dataset and can help us to estimate the computational needs.

### Top five smallest project by read size
```{r}
read_csv("../../results/read_size_asc.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
head(5)
```

### Top five highest project by read size
```{r}
read_csv("../../results/read_size_desc.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) %>% 
head(5)
```
