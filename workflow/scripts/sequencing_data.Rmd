<!-- # Sequencing Data -->
## Quick glimpse
Read sequencing data may be obtained from different sources. The most common ones include:

1. Reads from sequencing platforms for research purposes.
2. Reads downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) using the SraToolkit functions.
3. Reads synthesized using special simulation software
- Most `insilico` data is used for testing software before using real data.
- Generating `insilico` data can be challenging but not can provide a starting data for testing some pipelines.
- Below is a demo for generating NovaSeq, MiSeq and HiSeq `insilico` sequencing data. Most suitable for testing metagenomics analysis tools.

## How to resize Fastq Files
- Sometimes we want to extract a small subset to test the bioinformatics pipeline.
- You can resize the fastq files using the `seqkit sample` function [@seqkit2022].
- Below is a quick demo for extracting only 0.1% of paired-end metagenomics sequencing data.

```bash
mkdir -p data
for i in {77..78}
  do
    cat SRR102452$i\_R1.fastq \
    | seqkit sample -p 0.01 \
    | seqkit shuffle -o data/SRR102452$i\_R1_sub.fastq \
    | cat SRR102452$i\_R2.fastq \
    | seqkit sample -p 0.01 \
    | seqkit shuffle -o data/SRR102452$i\_R2_sub.fastq
  done
```
